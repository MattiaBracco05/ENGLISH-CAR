                    Henry Ford is the founder of the "Ford Motor Company", a car manufacturing company, which still today represents one of the largest industries in the United States and in the world that at the beginning of the 1900s gave birth to the II industrial revolution
                    by inventing the assembly line, a process used in modern industries introduced with the aim of optimizing the work of the workers and reducing time. This process is formed by a conveyor belt that runs carrying with it the different
                    objects to be assembled to obtain the finished product allowing the workers not to have to move. The first car to be built with this process was the Ford Model T. The Ford company currently markets automobiles and commercial vehicles
                    of various types under the Ford brand but also deals in luxury cars under the Lincoln brand. Among the most famous British manufacturers we find the Mini which makes a small car suitable for city life, there are also the "Cooper SE"
                    (full electric) and "Cooper S" models for lovers of sporty driving. As for sports cars produced by British car manufacturers, the best known brands are Jaguar, Lotus and McLaren. "Jaguar Land Rover" is a multinational based in Coventry
                    (West Midlands), Lotus is based in a former air base near Norwich while Aston Martin, born in the early 1900s with the name "Bamford & Martin" , is a small company that produces Gran Turismo made with artisanal care. Turning instead
                    to luxury cars, Bentley is the main supplier of the royal family and has won the "24 Hours of Le Mans" 6 times. You have probably already heard of Land Rover and Rage Rover ... contrary to what many think, these 2 types of SUVs are
                    part of the same car manufacturer: the "Land Rover". A "Range Rover" is nothing more than a specific model of "Land Rover" whose full name would be "Land Rover Range Rover" just like the name "Mustang" is short for "Ford Mustang".
                    To return to the production of the F1-based McLaren we cannot fail to mention the MP4, the car presented for the 1998 season with which the drivers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost won 15 of the 16 GPs. While Lotus, in 1980, agreed with
                    DeLorean for the construction of the DMC-12, this car was also the inspiration for the film. "Back to the Future". For the new supercars Naran Automotive has produced 49 units that will be sold for around € 1,000,000, it has a 5.0
                    biturbo V8 engine, with 1036 HP and can reach a top speed of 370 km/h. The Aston Martin Valhalla is another exclusive project that will see the production of around 500 units per year starting in 2023, this car is equipped with a hybrid
                    system that will be able to deliver a total of 950 hp and 1,000 Nm of torque.
